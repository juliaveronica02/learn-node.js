## Global Features vs Core Modules vs Third Party Modules.
* Global features: keywords like const or function but also some global objects like process.
* Core node.js modules: examples would be the file-systems module ("fs"), the path module ("path") or the http module ("http").
* Third party modules: installed via npm-install. we can add any kind of feature to our app via this way.
* global features are always available, so we don't need to import them into the files where we want to use them.
* core nodejs module don't need to be installed (NO npm INSTALL is required), but we need to import them when we want to use features exposed by them.
